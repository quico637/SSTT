    <h1> Error 415 </h1>
    <h3>Unsupported Media Type</h3>
    
    The HTTP 415 Unsupported Media Type client error response code indicates that the server refuses to accept the request because the payload format is in an unsupported format.
The format problem might be due to the request's indicated Content-Type or Content-Encoding, or as a result of inspecting the data directly.
